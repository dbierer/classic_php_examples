Is that really how you feel?
Oh, you're such a kidder!
I take that as a compliment.
Do you really mean that?
I sense some hostility.
Did you say that because I'm a woman?
I think you're overreacting.
You probably need to think again about what you're saying.
Did you have a bad dream last night?
Are you upset about that?
