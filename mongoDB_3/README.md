# MongoDB 3 Examples

* The examples in this repo are mainly based on work which I did in 2013.  It's based on MongoDB 3.4 and uses the old (and now deprecated) `Mongo` PHP Database driver.
	* For more information about this driver see: http://php.net/manual/en/book.mongo.php.
* If you are starting a new project, it is recommended that you use MongoDB 4 or above, and the currently maintained `MongoDB` driver
	* For more information about the new driver see: http://php.net/manual/en/set.mongodb.php
	* Look for a directory `mongoDB_4` for examples using this driver
