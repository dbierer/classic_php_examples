Preparatory Steps for the Streams Exercise: 
(From the command line of the Training VM)

1. mkdir /usr/local/Zend/apache2/passwd

2. mkdir /usr/local/Zend/apache2/htdocs/admin

3. Create the file .htaccess to the admin directory (from your computer to the VM)
   as follows:

	AuthType Basic
	AuthName "Password Required"
	AuthUserFile /usr/local/Zend/apache2/passwd/.htpasswd
	Require user administrator

4. Populate the admin directory by copying a dozen or so random files into it

5. Create the encrypted password file:

    cd /usr/local/Zend/apache2/passwd
    ../bin/htpasswd -c .htpasswd administrator

    NOTE: You'll need to enter the administrator password twice

6. Test access to this directory: http://IP-ADDRESS/admin/
    You should get a prompt for username and password.

    Username = administrator
    Password = password

7. Now you can write the code for the exercise.
